# Scripting-TicTacToe

Welcome to Scripting-TicTacToe, where you can play the famous tic-tac-toe game directly on the computer console. This Python project brings the classic two-player game to life, providing an enjoyable and interactive gaming experience for intermediate-level developers.

# Overview
Tic-tac-toe is a well-known paper-and-pencil game played on a 3x3 grid. The objective is simple: two players take turns marking their respective symbols (usually "X" and "O") on the grid, aiming to form a line of three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal. This project implements the game logic and user interface within the console, allowing players to have fun and challenge each other.

# Features
Scripting-TicTacToe comes with several exciting features:

## Two Players Enter Their Names
At the start of the game, players are prompted to enter their names. This personalized experience makes the game more engaging and competitive.

## Play and Show Results
Players take turns entering their moves on the 3x3 grid until the game reaches a conclusion. The application then displays the results, indicating whether a player won, lost, or if the game ended in a draw.

## Two Types of Play Again Options
After a game is completed, players have two options to play again:

- Play Again with New Players: Start a new game with different players, offering a fresh challenge each time.
- Play Again with the Same Players: Play another round with the same players, allowing for a rematch.

## Score Tracking
Scripting-TicTacToe keeps track of each player's wins, losses, and draws throughout their gaming sessions. This feature lets players compete and strive to improve their performance.

## Clean and Updated UI
The console interface is designed for clarity and ease of use. Players are guided through the game with clear instructions and updates after each move. The UI remains clean and well-organized throughout the entire gaming experience.
